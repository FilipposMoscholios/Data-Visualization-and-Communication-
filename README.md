# Data-Visualization-and-Communication-
This course from my MSc in Data Science contains two Projects. The first one includes a deep analysis to examine the percentage of incidents affected by dementia. The second one is a deep analysis to examine departure delays in airports. Both are implemented in R and the second one contains implementations in Tableau.
